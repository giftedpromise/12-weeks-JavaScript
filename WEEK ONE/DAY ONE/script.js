Learning Objectives:
Understand what JavaScript is and its role in web development.
Set up a development environment for JavaScript.
Topics to Cover:
What is JavaScript?

JavaScript's history and evolution.
The role of JavaScript in web development (front-end and back-end).
Difference between JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
Setting Up the Development Environment:

Installing a code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
Installing Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager).
Setting up a basic project structure.
Your First JavaScript Program:

Writing and running a basic JavaScript program.
Using the browser's developer tools. 

What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a programming language used to create dynamic and interactive web content.
It was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 and has since become one of the core technologies of the web.
JavaScript can be used for both client-side (in the browser) and server-side (with Node.js) development.
Setting Up the Development Environment:

Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code):
Go to Visual Studio Code and download the installer for your operating system.
Follow the installation instructions.
Install Node.js and npm:
Go to the Node.js website and download the LTS version.
Run the installer and follow the instructions.
Verify the installation by opening a terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Terminal) and typing:
node -v
npm -v

Setting Up a Basic Project Structure:
Open VS Code.
Create a new folder for your project and open it in VS Code.
Create a new file named index.html and add the following basic HTML structure:
Create a new file named script.js in the same folder.
Your First JavaScript Program:

Open script.js and add the following code
console.log("Hello, World!");
Open index.html in a web browser (you can right-click the file in VS Code and select "Open with Live Server" if you have the Live Server extension installed, or simply double-click the file to open it in your default browser).
Open the browser's developer tools (right-click on the page and select "Inspect" or press F12).
Go to the "Console" tab in the developer tools to see the output of your JavaScript program.

console.log("Hello, world");
